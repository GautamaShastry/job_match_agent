Professional Summary
--------------------------------------------------
Master’s candidate in Computer Science (graduating Dec 2025) with hands-on experience delivering secure, scalable microservices, cloud-native deployments, and ML/NLP features—including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines using LangChain with FAISS/Qdrant for hybrid retrieval and LLM orchestration—from design through production. Core strengths include Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Spring Boot, React, Node.js, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD. Known for reducing latency and defects through systematic profiling, clean interfaces, and strong validation, and for raising reliability/engagement via fault-tolerant releases and data-driven UI improvements. Comfortable working across the stack, documenting standards, and collaborating in Agile teams.

Experience

Associate Software Engineer
Backflipt – Hyderabad, India
Jan 2023 – Dec 2023

- Modularized a monolithic UI into React + Redux feature slices to separate concerns (state, side effects, view), improve component reuse, and de-duplicate logic. Result: +20% user engagement and cleaner code boundaries for faster iteration.
- Eliminated render bottlenecks by profiling components; introduced React hooks, strategic memoization (React.memo / useMemo / useCallback), and granular component splits to constrain diff scopes. Result: -40% re-render overhead and -10% page load time under typical workloads.
- Reduced network-induced latency by normalizing Redux entities, adding cache layers for idempotent reads, and debouncing chatty UI triggers; streamlined client–server request patterns. Result: -15% response latency and fewer redundant calls.
- Standardized UI/UX practices (layout patterns, naming conventions, state ownership) with Confluence documentation and example flows, enabling consistent contributions across squads. Result: -25% new-hire ramp-up time and smoother cross-team handoffs.

Projects
--------------------------------------------------
Document Assistant | FastAPI, LangChain, FAISS, RAG, Ollama, Hugging Face
Aug 2025 – Sept 2025

- Built a FastAPI RAG service with endpoints for /upload, /query, /stream-query, and vector-store admin (/stores, /metrics); pipeline: upload → validate → chunk (avg ~555 chars) → embed → FAISS index → answer with citation-enforced prompt + refusals.
- Delivered k=4 retrieval in 0.038 s avg (0.027–0.059 s range) on the test suite; created a compact store (~0.02 MB, 10 vectors) and 5.57 chunks/sec embedding throughput.
- Implemented full vector-store lifecycle (create/load/add/delete/list/stats) and supports cached retrievers (similarity/MMR) for repeat queries; exposes store stats (size, file count, embedding dim).
- Shipped ops & quality gates: health/metrics/store-stats endpoints and an automated test suite with 4/4 passing (100% success, 0 failures) across ingest, index, retrieve, and generate.

Student Survey Application | Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, AWS, Rancher
Mar 2025 – May 2025

- Designed RESTful APIs in Spring Boot using Spring Data JPA and strict validation annotations (@NotNull, @NotBlank, @Email), preventing bad inputs and ensuring consistent schema adherence from day one.
- Provisioned Amazon RDS MySQL 8 and tuned HikariCP (maxPool=20, minIdle=5) with appropriate connection/test settings to maintain throughput during concurrent spikes without saturating DB resources.
- Containerized with OpenJDK 23 and published version-tagged images; deployed a 3-replica Kubernetes workload on EC2 (NodePort) via Rancher to ensure redundancy and predictable rollouts. Achieved 99.9% uptime during pilot.
- Built a Git-triggered Jenkins pipeline (Maven build → Docker image → K8s health-checked rollout) to automate testing and deployments, enabling zero-downtime releases in under 5 minutes.
- Hardened correctness with Postman test suites on critical endpoints pre- and post-deployment; 10+ production submissions executed with zero validation/runtime errors.

Taskify – Task Management Web App | Vite + React.js, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Docker
Jan 2025 – Feb 2025

- Built a full-stack React + Express + MongoDB application with role-based access, guarded routes, and end-to-end CRUD workflows, enabling reliable team task management.
- Implemented authentication/authorization using JWT and bcrypt password hashing; enforced protected routes and role checks across the SPA to ensure least-privilege access. Outcome: -25% login issues and fewer failed sessions.
- Accelerated task discovery by shipping real-time search, filtering, and sorting (20+ combinations) and by adding the right MongoDB indexes on hot fields, cutting mean query time and improving perceived responsiveness by ~15%.
- Stabilized local/dev parity via Docker Compose; formalized REST endpoints (error codes, timeouts, retries) and centralized Redux state to avoid race conditions during concurrent edits. Result: smoother UI updates and fewer desyncs.

Resume Analyzer | React.js, Spring Boot, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Render, Vercel, Docker
Feb 2025 – May 2025

- Built an AI screening workflow with spaCy NER and a custom scoring pipeline; validated against a labeled sample to achieve 87% accuracy while keeping p95 latency < 1.5s per document.
- Secured data flows using Spring Security (JWT) and JPA; defined typed contracts, timeouts, and retry logic between the Java API and Python microservice to mitigate transient failures. Outcome: zero API errors over 15+ resumes processed.
- Deployed cost-effectively on Render (backend + AI) and Vercel (frontend) with autoscaling and health checks, maintaining 99.95% uptime for <$50/month without manual ops burden.

Portfolio | React.js, Tailwind CSS, AWS S3, AWS CloudFront, AWS Route 53, AWS ACM
Jan 2025 – Jul 2025

- Delivered a SPA (Single Page Application) with 90+ Lighthouse scores across performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO through bundle trimming, lazy loading, and semantic structure.
- Optimized global delivery by serving static assets from S3 behind CloudFront, tuning cache/TTL and compression, and optimizing images, resulting in 193 ms average TTFB and an A (89%) SpeedVitals grade.
- Enforced security with ACM-issued HTTPS, HSTS preload, and a CloudFront origin policy to block direct S3 access; passed audits with zero critical Security Hub findings.
- Maintained 99.95% uptime using Route 53 health checks and CloudFront monitoring; increased user engagement by ~15% via subtle Framer Motion animations (section reveals, transitions, hover effects).
